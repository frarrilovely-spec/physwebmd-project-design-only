You are an expert full-stack React developer and product designer.

GOAL
Build a modern, minimal “tech-health” style single-page web app for a US psychiatry practice called **PsychWebMD** (psychwebmd.com).

The app must include:

1. A redesigned, high-conversion **homepage**.
2. A full **Appointment module** with:
   - New Patient multi-step flow
   - Enhanced Existing Patient flow
   - (Optional) Intake Form placeholder
3. Clean, responsive, production-quality UI (desktop + mobile).

Use React (functional components with hooks). You can use plain CSS or CSS-in-JS. No external UI library is required, but you may use Tailwind-like utility classes if that’s easier.

GENERAL DESIGN SYSTEM
- Style: modern, minimal, tech-health (similar to Talkiatry / Cerebral).
- Colors:
  - Primary teal: #17B8A6
  - Dark slate text: #1B1F2B
  - Soft gray background: #F7F9FB
  - White: #FFFFFF
- Typography:
  - Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., system font stack or Inter).
  - Clear hierarchy: h1, h2, h3, body, small.
- Layout:
  - Max-width container ~1100–1200px, centered.
  - Generous spacing between sections.
  - Rounded cards (border-radius ~16px) with very soft shadows.
- Buttons:
  - Primary: filled teal with white text; hover: slightly darker teal.
  - Secondary: white with border and teal text.
- Links:
  - Understated; teal text; underline on hover.

APP STRUCTURE
Build at least these components:

- `App` – overall layout, header, sections, booking modal.
- `Header` – top navigation, sticky on scroll.
- `HeroSection`
- `StartYourJourneyCard`
- `KeyBenefitsSection`
- `HowItWorksSection`
- `ProvidersSection`
- `ConditionsSection`
- `TestimonialsSection`
- `InsuranceSection`
- `WhyPsychWebMDSection`
- `CallToActionSection`
- `Footer`
- `AppointmentModal` – shows when user clicks “Book Appointment” or selects a journey option.
- `AppointmentTabs` – New Patient / Existing Patient / Intake Form.
- `NewPatientFlow` – multi-step wizard.
- `ExistingPatientFlow` – enhanced flow.
- `Stepper` component for progress display.
- Shared `FormField`, `RadioGroup`, `Select`, `Card` components where useful.

Make the page scrollable as a normal landing page. The appointment flows should appear inside a centered modal overlay (or full-screen on mobile).

==================================================
1. HEADER & GLOBAL LAYOUT

    - “Providers”
    - “Conditions”
    - “Insurance”
  - Primary button: **“Book Appointment”**.

When “Book Appointment” is clicked, open the `AppointmentModal` with the appointment tabs.

  - `index.(js|jsx)` and other components
  - CSS (inline, CSS file, or styled-components – your choice)

Return the full React project code ready to run on Replit.
